                In many moments of daily life, Dasein needs a helper to understand the unknown and make choices. That helper is "Das Man," or "they." Das Man is not a specific or fixed Dasein, nor a collection of certain Daseins, but rather an average. Heidegger wrote “The ‘they’, which is nothing definite, and which all are, though not as the sum, prescribe kind of being of everydayness.” (Heidegger, H.127) Dasein's daily life is always full of uncertainties and unknowns, and with the help of Das Man, Dasein can effortlessly make a choice without feeling responsible for the decision. The answer to this average is already there, existing before Dasein decides, so they do not have to think more about it. Although Das Man reduces the options available to Dasein and sometimes even masquerades as the only option, this approach allows Dasein to some extent to escape the responsibility that comes with the choice. After choosing to follow them, Dasein's own choices in everyday life are averaged out and become part of Das Man. Dasein makes the same actions and choices as "they," and here there is an illusion - "they" are always right. An example of this is "popular", which means the choice and average of the vast majority of people. People who pursue popular and fashionable things are also following Das Man. When faced with choices and challenges, individuals often look to see what "they" do or how to choose. For instance, when I first came to the U.S., I was overwhelmed with how to order at the salad counter, and my only solution was to imitate other people, i.e., "they" and act the same way. When faced with a choice, Dasein also uses "they" as a guide. For example, when choosing which movie to watch, people look up the movie's rating on IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes and use that as a basis for judgment. The overall rating of a movie is not based on the opinion of a Dasein or a group of certain dasein but rather an average, true average score based on all the reviews. However, this way of deciding has its problems because for everyone, the experience and feeling of a movie will be unique. While providing an average, comprehensive reference for Dasein, Das Man also eliminates many possibilities, and in the process, Dasein, who makes the decision, becomes a part of Das Man. Das Man defines everyday life, and the everyday Dasein loses its own self. “The Self of everyday Dasein is the they-self, which we distinguish from the authentic self”, Heidegger said. (Heidegger, H.129)
