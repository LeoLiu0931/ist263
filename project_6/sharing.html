            <img src="../project/Media/Moanin.jpg" alt="Art Blackey - Moanin, 1958">
            <p>This album is definitely a milestone in hard bop jazz. Especially the moanin in it, which composition by Bobby Timmons, made famous by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in their 1958 album of the same name. This piece has already become a jazz standard.</p>

            <img src="../project/Media/mingus_ah_um.jpg" alt="Charles Mingus - Mingus ah um, 1959">
            <p>This album is renowned for its blend of gospel, blues, and hard bop elements. Key tracks from the album include "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat," a tribute to the late saxophonist Lester Young, and "Fables of Faubus," a protest song against Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus's segregationist policies. Other notable pieces include "Better Git It in Your Soul," inspired by gospel music and blues, and "Self-Portrait in Three Colors," which was originally written for the film "Shadows." The album stands out for its emotional depth and musical complexity, making it one of the defining works of jazz in the 20th century and a significant contribution to the genre's evolution. </p>

            <img src="../project/Media/apaleview.jpg" alt="Kazuo Ishiguro - A Pale View of Hills, 1982">
            <p>A Pale View of the Hills was the first book I read by Kazuo Ishiguro. The novel is known for its haunting and evocative prose, as well as its complex narrative structure. Ishiguro employs flashbacks and a non-linear storytelling technique to explore themes of memory, loss, and the difficulties of reconciling past and present. "A Pale View of Hills" showcases Ishiguro's skill in creating atmospheric and introspective narratives, a characteristic that defines much of his later work.</p>
