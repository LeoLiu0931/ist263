            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <hr>
            In <strong>2020</strong>, I enrolled at Syracuse University and began my campus life. 
            Throughout my first year of college, I was never sure of my major. 
            In my second year, I transferred to ischool and chose <strong>Applied Data Analytics</strong> as my major, and out of interest, I also chose Philosophy as my minor.
            <br>
            In college, I have learned a lot about data analysis and other technologies that I believe will be the foundation of my future career. 
            <br>
            In the spring of this year, I entered the Deloitte Consulting Apprenticeship Program. 
            In the summer after, I got an internship at <strong>Deloitte</strong>.
